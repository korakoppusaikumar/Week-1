**Predicting Solar Power Output**    This project predicts solar panel power output using historical data and linear regression. The data is analyzed for structure, correlations, and quality, then split into training and testing sets. The model is evaluated using metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ², aiding renewable energy planning.
